The Global Message Service
==========================

The Global Message Service broadcasts messages across a social network.

The content of the messages are not the business of the GMS.

In the take your rights project, this is analogous to the 'wall' command in Linux, except that it is also the universal message bus.

Right now, probably none of this makes sense.  Don't worry about it just yet.  This is a pseudo-transport layer for applications that are to come.
